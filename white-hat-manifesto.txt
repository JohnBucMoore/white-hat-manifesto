1. Attendance: I will arrive at the Fullstack campus (online or in-person) on time and prepared for class. I understand that I must maintain 95% attendance unless otherwise designated in accordance with my signed Student Enrollment Agreement and Academic Catalog
2. If I am late, need to leave early, or have any unplanned absences, I will provide the Fullstack staff with a timely explanation and make up missed work.
3. I will attend Fullstack Academy every scheduled day through the last day of class. If I need to be absent, I will give ample notice. I understand that Fullstack Academy will make every effort to ensure I am able to make up work missed, however, Fullstack cannot guarantee that I will be able to make up 100% of the benefits and workshops I miss by being absent.
4. I will actively and wholeheartedly participate in all workshops, assignments, activities and assessments that are part of the Fullstack experience.
5. I understand that Fullstack Academy reserves the right to modify my course completion timeline, including requiring that I repeat a portion of the course or dismissal from the program based on poor academic performance.
6. For Immersive Students: I will make learning and class participation my top priority throughout the Fullstack Academy program. I understand that applying for jobs is a time-consuming process.  As such, I should refrain from working and applying to jobs until Hiring Day.
7. I will only submit work that is my own. I acknowledge that violations of Fullstack’s academic integrity standards, including cheating, plagiarizing, copying another student’s work and violating copyrights on printed material or software, are subject to disciplinary actions up to and including dismissal.

I will not reproduce, save or copy any educational materials provided to me for any use other than my own personal study. I will not make public (e.g. by posting online) any such study workshops, materials, or code provided to me by Fullstack.
9. I will be respectful and conduct myself professionally while at Fullstack or in the community (at meet-ups, hackathons, at other schools, with employers, recruiters, etc.). I understand that repeated violations of this policy can result in my dismissal from Fullstack Academy.

I understand that actions undertaken are my own and that Fullstack will not be liable for any illegal activities resulting from my gross negligence, willful misconduct, and/or bad faith conducted on Fullstack's premises (physical or virtual). Accordingly, I will be responsible for any and all costs and/or damages resulting from my actions.
